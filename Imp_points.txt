module
require

Every file in a NODE is a module

using module which we have exported [names]

./ -> imp when we have to create our own module 

exports: {} -> its an object

Built-in MODULES
    - OS
    - PATH
    - FS
    - HTTP

Async function works on callBACK;
callback ? we run callback funtion when we are done

FS -> file system
    --readFileSync && writeFileSync
    * if Syncing takes to much time our application will be down 
        hence its better to use Async rather than Sync

    --readFile && writeFile 
    * this is async [prefable]
